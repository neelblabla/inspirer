Welcome to the source code of inspirer_1.0 written on Python exploiting Google Drive APIs, PyDrive library and Crontab job scheduler.

inspirer_1.0 is an app to remind you of the 'custom messages' that inspired you at some point. Very often, we screenshot pictures of things, messages or moments that we resonate with - the ones that ring a bell with us - the ones that inspire us and make us feel good and motivated. And almost everytime, within days we forget about them. It's not until we scroll through our phone galleries when these images with amazing custom messages hit us again and we sigh! In those moments, if you wished the existence of an 'automated reminder' of these custom messages that you resonated with once - than inspirer_1.0 can come in handy. It emails you these screenshots at desired frequency to keep the adrenaline high! 

It is simple:
- move your custom screenshots/images to a Google Drive
- set inspirer_1.0 on your machine one time (feel free to reach out for the setup)
- receive custom motivational emails from yourself - daily/weekly/monthly
- be inspired!
